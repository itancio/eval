    "Who can I claim as dependents on my tax return?",
    "Generally, you can claim someone as a dependent if they are your qualifying child or qualifying relative who meets specific IRS criteria related to relationship,\
        age (for children), residency, financial support (you must provide more than half of their support), and certain income limits. \
        They must also have a valid taxpayer identification number (such as a Social Security Number) by the due date of your return.",
  ],
  [
    "Are tips and overtime pay taxable?",
    "Yes, both tips and overtime pay are taxable income and are subject to federal income tax, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. If you receive \
        $20 or more in tips a month from one employer, report all your tips to that employer, who will include them on your Form W‑2. \
        Overtime pay is simply additional wages and is taxed the same way as regular pay.",
  ],
  [
    "I only had part-time income this year and made less than the standard deduction amount. Do I still need to file a tax return?",
    "It depends on your filing status, age, and other factors such as self-employment earnings or if you owe certain taxes. \
        Generally, if your gross income is below a certain threshold, you might not be required to file. \
        However, you may still want to file if you’re eligible for refundable credits (like the Earned Income Credit) or \
        if you had taxes withheld that you’d like refunded. Publication 17 provides charts that can help you determine if you must file.",
  ],
  [
    "I got married this year. Which filing status should I choose—Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately?",
    "Many married couples benefit from filing jointly because it often results in a lower total tax due. \
        However, in certain cases—such as when one spouse has high medical expenses or other deductible costs—Married Filing Separately may be beneficial. \
        Publication 17 offers guidance and worksheets to compare outcomes. It’s often wise to calculate both ways or consult a tax professional.",
  ],
  [
    "How do I know if I should take the standard deduction or itemize my deductions?",
    "If your total allowable itemized expenses (e.g., mortgage interest, state and local taxes, charitable contributions, and certain medical expenses) \
        exceed your standard deduction, itemizing may lower your taxable income more. If your itemized deductions are below the standard deduction, \
        you generally benefit more by taking the standard deduction. Publication 17 provides details about what expenses can be itemized.",
  ],
  [
    "What is my Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and why is it important?",
    "AGI is your total income (wages, interest, dividends, business income, etc.) minus certain adjustments (like IRA contributions, \
        student loan interest, and other “above-the-line” deductions). Your AGI is important because it influences which credits and deductions \
        you can claim and how much tax you ultimately owe. You calculate your AGI before claiming either the standard deduction or your itemized deductions.",
  ],
  [
    "I have a young child and pay for daycare so I can work. Can I get a credit for those expenses?",
    "Yes. The **Child and Dependent Care Credit** can help offset some of the costs for child or dependent care. \
        You must meet certain criteria—such as having earned income and paying the care expenses to allow you to work or look for work. \
        Publication 17 explains how to figure the credit, the income limits, and the documentation required.",
  ],

  [
    "What “above-the-line” deductions can I take before arriving at my AGI?",
    "Some common “above-the-line” deductions include contributions to a Traditional IRA, student loan interest, \
        self-employment health insurance premiums, and educator expenses (if you’re a qualified teacher). \
        Claiming these deductions reduces your taxable income and may help you qualify for other benefits. \
        Check Publication 17 for the full list and eligibility conditions.",
  ],
  [
    "I started a small side business this year. Do I have to pay self-employment tax?",
    " If your net earnings from self-employment are \$400 or more, you’ll likely need to file a Schedule SE to calculate and pay self-employment tax \
        (Social Security and Medicare taxes for self-employed individuals). You’ll include this along with your personal income tax return (Form 1040). \
        Publication 17 offers guidance on self-employment tax rules, deductions for small businesses, and recordkeeping.",

  [
    "I’m a single parent with two children, and I earned about $30,000 this year from my job. \
        I’ve heard about the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) but am unsure if I qualify. \
        What are the main requirements to claim the EITC?",
    "The EITC is designed for workers who earn low to moderate incomes, especially those who have qualifying children. \
        To qualify, you generally need to have earned income (such as wages or self-employment income), a valid Social Security Number \
        for yourself (and each qualifying child), and meet certain income limits, which vary by filing status and number of children. \
        You cannot file your return as “Married Filing Separately,” and your investment income must be below a specific threshold. \
        If you meet the age (at least 25 if you have no children) and residency requirements, and your total or adjusted gross income is within the limits \
        set for your situation, you could receive a refundable credit. Because you have two children and your earnings are around $30,000, \
        you may very well qualify, but check the exact thresholds in the IRS EITC tables or consult a tax professional to be sure.",

    "How can I contact the IRS?",
    "You can contact the IRS by phone at 1-800-829-1040 for individual tax help (Monday–Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time). \
        For general information, forms, and online tools, visit IRS.gov. You can also schedule an appointment at a local Taxpayer Assistance Center \
        by calling 844-545-5640. Hearing-impaired individuals may use the TTY/TDD number 1-800-829-4059.",
